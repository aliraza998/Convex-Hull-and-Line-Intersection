# Design and Analysis of Convex Hull and Line Intersection Algorithms

# Introduction
Geometric algorithms play a crucial role in computer science, offering solutions for spatial problem-solving. This
project delves into the implementation of key geometric algorithms in Java, focusing on line intersection and convex
hull computations. An interactive GUI allows users to engage directly with these algorithms, providing a hands-on
experience for understanding their mechanics and applications. The project aims to bridge theoretical concepts
with practical implementation, offering insights into algorithmic efficiency and usability.

# Tools and Technologies
The system is implemented in Java using the Swing framework on NetBeans. The graphical interface allows users
to interactively input points and line segments. A clear
diagram illustrates the system architecture, depicting how
the algorithms are integrated into the user interface. This
section discusses the choice of programming language,
GUI framework, and the overall design philosophy.

# Experimental Setup
The experimental setup involves a user-centric interface,
enabling users to interactively draw points and line segments on the screen. The application offers a variety
of algorithms for users to choose from, including Brute
Force, Graham Scan, Jarvis March, Quick Elimination,
and Andrew’s Monotone for convex hull solutions, as well
as Slope Comparison, Cross Product Test, and CounterClockwise Test for line intersection. This setup is designed to cater to both educational and research purposes,
allowing for a comprehensive analysis of each algorithm’s
performance under different scenarios.

# Conclusion
The project underscores the blend of theoretical algorithms with practical software solutions, highlighting the significance of geometric computations in real-world applications. The successful execution of these algorithms in a user-friendly Java application paves the way for future exploration, particularly in optimizing these algorithms for high-performance computing and expanding their applicability in fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
